# Neural Networks

This directory includes a brief overview of the data sets used during the research project. 
Additionally it will include all neural networks that were constructed during the research project. 
Since one aim of the project is to implement and deploy a functioning network onto a racecar using the computational resources of an  [embedded GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-agx-xavier-developer-kit) , a major part of the project is the selection and adaptation of a suitable base network. Therefore only efficient segmentation models are under consideration.
